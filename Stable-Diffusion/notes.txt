Stable Diffusion
Stable diffusion is a text-to-image deep learning model, based on diffusion models.

What is a Generative model?
A generative model learns a probability distribution of the data set such that we can 
then sample from the distribution to create new instances of data. 
For example, if we have many pictures of cats and we train a generative model on it, 
we then sample from this distribution to create new images of cats.

Why do we model data as distributions?
Example: Imagine you're a criminal, and you want to generate thousands of fake 
identities. Each fake identity, is made up of variables, representing the 
characteristics of a person (Age, Height).

You can ask the Statistics Deparment of the Government to give you staistics about 
the age and the height of the population and then sample from these distributions.

At first, you may sample from each distribution independently to create a fake 
identity, but that would produce unreasonable pairs of (Age and Height).

To generate fake identities that make sense, you need the joint distribution,
otherwise you may end up with an unreasonable combination of age and height.

We can also evaluate probabilities on one of the two variables using conditional
probability and/or by marginalizing a variable.
