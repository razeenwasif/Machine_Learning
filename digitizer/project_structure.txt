Assistive Tool for Digitizing Handwritten Notes
* Extend it to recognize entire words, not just characters.
* Combine with OCR (e.g., Tesseract OCR) for handwriting-to-text conversion.
* Create a note-taking tool that digitizes handwritten notes into editable text.

1. Modify the Dataset & Preprocessing
 *  need to preprocess input images to segment words instead of single characters.
 
2. Update the Model Architecture
 * Use a CNN + RNN (LSTM/GRU) to capture character sequences.
 * Switch from CrossEntropyLoss to CTC Loss (Connectionist Temporal Classification) to handle variable-length predictions.

3. Update the Training Pipeline
  * Instead of predicting a single character, the model should output a sequence of characters.
  * We can use CTC decoding to align predicted characters with input images.
  
4. Experiment & Fine-Tune
  * Train on a word-level dataset.
  * Fine-tune hyperparameters using Optuna

=======================================================================================
Generate a Synthetic Dataset
    Use PIL (Pillow) to render words with different handwritten fonts.
    Randomly select words from a dictionary or dataset (e.g., English words list).
    Apply transformations to make it look more like real handwriting.

2. Apply Data Augmentation

To improve generalization, weâ€™ll add:

    Rotation & Skewing (to mimic slanted handwriting).
    Noise & Blur (to simulate ink smudges).
    Random Distortion (to vary letter shapes).

3. Save the Dataset

    Store images in a structured format (e.g., dataset/word_image.png with labels in labels.csv).
    Split into train, validation, and test sets.
=======================================================================================

1. Modify the Data Loader

Since you're now working with word images instead of characters, you'll need to:

    Load word images from synthetic_dataset/.
    Create a label mapping (e.g., storing word-image pairs in a CSV or JSON file).
    Ensure images are correctly preprocessed (resized, normalized).

2. Update the Model Architecture

    Your current CNN is designed for single-character classification.
    For word-level recognition, you need a sequence-based model:
        CNN + RNN (LSTM/GRU) to capture sequential dependencies.
        CTC Loss (Connectionist Temporal Classification) to handle varying word lengths.

3. Train the Model

    Use PyTorch's DataLoader to feed images & labels.
    Implement CTC loss for sequence prediction.
    Train and evaluate performance on synthetic word images.

4. Evaluate & Fine-Tune

    Check accuracy and loss trends.
    Adjust hyperparameters using Optuna.
